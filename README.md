## ü§ñ xAI Integration

This application uses xAI to dynamically generate popular job roles, trending locations, and determine the most relevant job portals based on current market trends. The AI analyzes current job market data and provides up-to-date suggestions.

### How it works:
1. **Dynamic Job Portals**: Job portals are dynamically selected based on the job role and location using xAI
2. **Dynamic Content**: Popular jobs and locations are generated by xAI instead of being hardcoded
3. **Market Trends**: The AI considers current market trends, emerging technologies, and popular cities
4. **Fallback System**: If xAI is unavailable, the app gracefully falls back to curated static data
5. **Real-time Updates**: Content updates automatically when the page loads

### Available Job Portals:
- **Naukri**: Indian job portal
- **Indeed**: Global job search
- **LinkedIn**: Professional networking
- **Glassdoor**: Company reviews and jobs
- **Monster**: Job search platform
- **TimesJobs**: Indian job portal
- **Shine**: Indian job search
- **HackerRank**: Tech jobs
- **Upwork**: Freelance platform
- **Freelancer**: Freelance marketplace

### Setup:
1. Get your xAI API key from [https://x.ai/](https://x.ai/)
2. Add it to your `.env.local` file as `XAI_API_KEY`
3. The app will automatically start using dynamic content
